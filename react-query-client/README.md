React Query, now part of the @tanstack/query ecosystem, is a powerful library for managing server-side state in React applications. It simplifies fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating data from APIs or other external sources.

# Key Features of React Query
# Data Fetching and Caching: Automatically caches API responses for efficient re-renders Avoids unnecessary network requests by using cached data when available.

# Out-of-the-Box DevTools: A dedicated DevTools extension to monitor queries, cache, and performance.

# Automatic Background Updates: Refetches data in the background when the window refocuses or network reconnects.Query Invalidation:

Allows you to mark stale data and trigger automatic refetching when needed.
Optimistic Updates:

Instantly update the UI to reflect user actions, then sync with the server to finalize changes.
Pagination and Infinite Scroll:

Built-in support for paginated or infinite data loading.
TypeScript Support:

Provides strong typings for queries, mutations, and hooks, reducing runtime errors.
Prefetching and Hydration:

Preload data for better user experiences or hydrate initial server-side data on the client.
Error and Loading States Management:

Automatically tracks and provides loading, success, and error states for data requests.
Reactivity:

Subscribes to changes in query keys, ensuring data stays synchronized with the app state.
